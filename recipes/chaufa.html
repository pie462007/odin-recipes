    <h3>Soy Sauce Mix Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/8 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 pinches cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger (only add it if you are not using fresh ginger) if using fresh, use 1 tablespoon and cook it with the fresh veggies</li>
        <li>1 pinch of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This recipe moves pretty fast so get all of your veggies diced and minces and in order.</li>
        <li>Skinless chicken thighs is the preferred choice. They are full of flavor and they will taste amazing in this dish. If all you have is chicken breast, feel free do use that too.</li>
        <li>If you want to save time, use prepackaged already diced peppers, garlic and onion.</li>
        <li>Mix all these ingredients together in a small bowl: Soy sauce, sesame oil, a pinch or two of sugar, couple pinches of cumin, ground ginger. If you prefer to use fresh add 1 tablespoon. Do not add fresh ginger into the soy sauce mixture.  We will be cooking the ginger with the rest of the veggies.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the red bell peppers and onions. Sauté until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the fresh ginger (if using fresh ginger), garlic, and green onions. Add the chicken and carefully mix well, cooking for a couple of minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add half the rice. Mix well then add the rest of the rice. Mix well. Add the soy sauce mixture. Mix well then add the chopped scrambled eggs. Toss. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
